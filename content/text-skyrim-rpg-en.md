Have you ever wanted to make an RPG? I did and so I started a
project recently. I would like other people to join me and maybe we can
make a nice game together. I don't feel like typing too much so I'll use
a bulleted list

-   The game is to be purely text-based, running in command-line as an
    "interactive book" which however provides an extreme freedom in a
    similar way Skyrim does. We're not making any graphics (not even
    ASCII), sounds, icons or things like that. However in the future I
    plan to make a wrapper that would offer full 3D or 2D
    graphics experience. By giving up graphics, physics and other things
    in the beginnings we can focus on making a quality RPG core that
    will also be immediately playable.
-   Everything is open-source, multiplatform, pure C++, KISS, using as
    few libraries as possible and only the ones that are
    also open-source. No one is making any money, we just want to make a
    good game, that's why everyone can contribute only as much as they
    want and only when they want.
-   I gather most information (concepts, designs, coding
    conventions etc.) [in this
    document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jq0dE7DdXIpz_ytLAirXNP6_Oi0MdCSoMdU-_P1p9Lk/edit).

Wanna join? All you need to do is fork the GitHub repository, write some
code and submit it via pull request. Don't know where to begin? Just
take a look at the UML class diagram in the "other" folder on GitHub -
you'll find classes that need to be implemented there. Or just ask in
chat. But We're not only looking for programmers, the UML diagram needs
to be completed, we need to think about the game more, for example what
will its name be. Just connect to our chat. We're looking forward to
seeing you {{m.e(':)')}}
