My name is Miloslav Číž (Bc.) and I study computer science at [FIT BUT](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/).
I focus on computer graphics but my interests lie in more or less all exact sciences.
I also like many other things, such as music, sports etc.

As I believe in freedom of information, like lists and am a little bit narcissistic, I will
provide a lengthful info about myself.

## Fun facts

- I don't drink alcohol, I don't like its taste.
- I am a 100 % introvert acoording to psychological tests (melancholic, INTJ).
- I don’t have the sense of smell.
- I am a member of  Mensa.
- I can’t whistle.
- I have the CYP1A2-1A gene, which means I can drink cofee before I go to sleep.
- I suffer from depression and anxiety {{m.e(':(')}}
