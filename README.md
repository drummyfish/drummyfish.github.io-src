# tastyfish website

WORK IN PROGRESS

These are my personal websites hosted on GitHub, accesible [here](https://drummyfish.github.io/).

The website itself resides in repository [here](https://github.com/drummyfish/drummyfish.github.io).

The website sources for [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) are available in another repository [here](https://github.com/drummyfish/drummyfish.github.io-src).

The reason I keep the website and its sources in separate repos is that GitHub for some (security?) reason doesn't rebuild website from a repo that contains "weird" files, which in my case are Jinja templates containing an %import% directive.
