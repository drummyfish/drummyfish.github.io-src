# drummyfish.github.io-src

These are Pelican source files for my website at https://drummyfish.github.io/ (repo at https://github.com/drummyfish/drummyfish.github.io). I keep the sources separate from the output files because GitHub refuses to build my pages from a repository that contains "weird" files.
